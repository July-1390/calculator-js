# calculator-js
A robust JavaScript calculator :smile:

I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Grid CSS
- JavaScript

Some JS practices that I used:
- 'for' loops
- JS functions
- Arrow functions
- textContent property
- event listeners with the event delegation pattern
- early return
- conditional (ternary) operator (?, :)
- pure function
- refactoring
- enumerations with objects
